# Real-Time Distributed Voting System ðŸ“©âš¡

This repository does not include the source code for this project. This is a demo of the voting system I created for the Gatineau Chin Baptist Church. It is a distributed system with the following web applications:
1. Vote submission UI web app
2. Data visualization and storage web app

A demo of this voting system can be found here: https://youtu.be/C_nQ7X7fV_M
